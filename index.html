            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>About me: I was born and raised in Auburn, WA. where I attended High School and enrolled in the cooking program my sophomre year. I began my cooking journey at that point. My junior year, I won 1st place in the state VICA competition for cooking. My senior year I was put in charge of running the cafe operation and overseeing the cafeteria. I then went onto South Seattle Community College to work on my Assoc. of Applied Science Degree in Culinary arts, gaining a certificate of completion in June 1997.</p> 
    
            <p>After working in the industry for a few years, I eventually moved onto construction, where I was a site foreman. In 2004, I was presented with an opportunity to work at Starbucks Coffee Co. as a lab assistant for the Research & developement group. During this time I met and married my beautiful, awesome wife, Carissa. I continued in that role until 2008 when the great recession sparked mass layoffs, which I was unfortuately a part of.</p>
    
            <p>From there I went into my most recent role as a X-Ray servicve technician. I received on the job training to maintain and repair various X-Ray machines and other medical equipment as my knowledge grew. I continued in this role for almost 13 years when I was unceremoniously laidoff. It was at that point that I was able to pivot once again and begin my journey into the world of code, hoping to get a more in demand career, and bulk up our retirement fund. Which brings us up to date on my life.</p>
